				<h4 class = 'subTwo'>One of the most infamous candidates of the 2016 US presidential election has to be Donald Trump. He is notoriously known for his remarks on immigrants and minority groups. Trump started his campaign with the claim that he was going to build a wall around Mexico to keep illegal immigrants out.  However, he has recently started to target Muslims. In December 2014, he called for "complete shutdown" of Muslims entering the country. He believes that Islam hates Americans and we should keep that hatred out. Because of people like him, Islam has a bad reputation across the world.</h4>
			  <h2>Flint Water Crisis</h2>
			  <img src = "flint.PNG"/>
			  <h4>Water is one of the most important necessities in order to survive. So what happens when you don't have any? Residents of Flint, Michigan, USA are facing a drinking water contamination crisis. It started in April 2014 and is still continuing today. After Flint changed its water source from treated Detroit Water and Sewerage Department water (which was sourced from Lake Huron as well as the Detroit River) to the Flint River,its drinking water had a series of problems that culminated with lead contamination, creating a serious public health danger.  Officials had failed to apply corrosion control treatment to the Flint River which has made Flint a living hell for its residents. The corrosive Flint River water caused lead from aging pipes to seep into the water supply, causing extremely elevated levels of the heavy metal. On January 5, 2016, the city was declared to be in a state of emergency by the Governor of Michigan, Rick Snyder, before President Barack Obama declared it as a federal state of emergency, authorizing additional help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security less than two weeks later. Governor Snyder issued an apology to citizens and promised to fix the problem, and then sent $28 million to Flint for supplies, medical care and infrastructure upgrades. However, many Flint residents are still suffering because of this water crisis.</h4>

			  <h2>Our Three Brothers</h2>
			  <img src = "indiana.PNG"/>
			  <h4>Three young Muslim men were brutally killed in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The bodies of Mohamedtaha Omar, 23, Adam Mekki, 20, and Muhammad Tairab, 17, were found in an abandoned home, known locally as a hangout spot for young adults. Police officers were responding to “unknown problem” when they found the bodies. Investigators described the triple homicides as execution-style murders. The three victims are of East African descent. Two of them, Omar and Tairab, were laid to rest three days after their bodies were found. Their deaths shocked the larger Muslim community, giving birth to the hashtag #OurThreeBrothers, reminiscent to the hashtag #OurThreeWinners, which emerged after the brutal death of three North Carolina Muslims last year. Unsurprisingly, this news was not highlighted by major media outlets until a couple of days later. The Muslim identity was also disclosed from headlines. This raises the question to why people of color are still facing so much discrimination in 2016.</h4>

				<img src = "sa.PNG"/>
				<h4>South America is one of the most underrated Islamic regions. However, there are many Muslims living in South America. Latin Americans are actually the fastest growing Muslim populations in the world. Argentina, Brazil and Mexico have the largest Muslim populations in South America. In South America, the Muslim population is mainly composed of wealthy immigrants from the Levant, including Lebanese and Syrians, but many have been converting to Islam. </h4>

				<img src = "paris.PNG"/>
				<h4>On the evening of November 13, 2015, Paris was attacked by a series of coordinated terrorist attacks. The attacks were executed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in retaliation for the French airstrikes on ISIL targets in Syria and Iraq. Three suicide bombers struck near the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, followed by suicide bombings and mass shootings at cafés, restaurants and a music venue in central Paris. The attacks were the deadliest on France since World War II, and the deadliest in the European Union since the Madrid train bombings in 2004.</h4>

				<h2 class = 'subOne'>Erased Identity: Muslims Being “Cleansed” From Central African Republic</h2>
				<img src = "africa.PNG"/>
				<h4>Christian militias in Central African Republic have carried out ethnic cleansing of the Muslim population during the country's ongoing civil war. The systematic targeting of Muslims in the Central African Republic (CAR), a nation ravaged by strife since March of 2013, has devolved into massive scale ethnic cleansing. However, few outside of the African nation and beyond the human rights community are even minimally aware of this humanitarian crisis. Anti-Balaka, a fundamentalist group comprised of animists and Christians, is forcing Muslims to worship in private, remove religious garb, and convert at gunpoint. Anti-Balaka's aim is simple: rid the nation of its Muslim population in any way possible. Anti-Muslim terrorism in CAR - which has claimed at least 6,000 lives, pushed 30,000 Muslims to live in UN protected enclaves, and left scores of mosques destroyed - remains a largely unknown menace. Anti-Balaka forces have benefited immensely from the lack of coverage. Their numbers have grown, and their violence is ever increasing in severity. In addition to compelling Muslims to convert and decimating mosques, reports about Muslims paying anti-Balaka militants large sums of money to spare their lives are widespread.</h4>

				<h2 class = 'subOne'>Islamic State Expansion Into Southeast Asia</h2>
				<img src = "isis.PNG"/>
				<h4>When we think of the Islamic State, we think of the Middle East. However, there has been speculation that Southeast Asia is the new target of opportunity for the Islamic State. Just in January, Islamic State leaders issued an open threat to Malaysia that it would attack if the government pursued its harsh crackdown on Muslim extremists: “If you catch us, we will only increase in number. But if you let us be, we will be closer to our goal of bringing back the rule of the caliph. We will never bow down to the democratic system of governance as we will only follow Allah’s rules.”</h4>
				<h2 class = 'subOne'>Syrian Refugee Crisis</h2>
				<img src = "syria.PNG"/>
				<h4>As of February 2016, the United Nations (UN) has identified 13.5 million Syrians requiring humanitarian assistance, of which 6.6 million are internally displaced within Syria, and over 4.8 million are refugees outside of Syria.  Turkey is the largest host country with over 2.7 million Syrian refugees, and has spent more than 8 billion Euros on direct assistance. Children affected by the Syrian conflict are at risk of becoming ill, malnourished, abused, or exploited. Millions have been forced to quit school. </h4>
				<h4>Between 2 million and 3 million Syrian children are not attending school. The U.N. children’s agency says the war reversed 10 years of progress in education for Syrian children. Syrians have been seeking refuge in many countries, but have been denied or have limited entrance. Many refugees have also been accused of being illegal immigrants rather than refugees seeking help. After the Paris attacks occurred, Syrian refugees were accused of these crimes. </h4>
				<h2>Uighurs: Chinese Muslims Being Persecuted</h2>
				<img src = "rohingya.PNG"/>
				<h4>As millions of people worldwide prepared to observe Ramadan this year, one group of Muslims in western China were once again prevented from fully practicing the holy month’s traditions. The Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking ethnic group indigenous to the Xinjiang region, were limited in their religious observance by bans on fasting for civil servants, students and teachers, and instructions to restaurateurs, including Muslims, to keep their businesses open. Between 1949 and 2008, the portion of Xinjiang’s population comprised by Han Chinese increased from 6.7 percent to 40 percent. This demographic shift—combined with competition for economic opportunities and government constraints on the religious expression of Muslim Uighurs—has created a rift between the two ethnic groups. The Chinese government is directing a crushing campaign of religious repression against China’s Muslim Uighurs in the name of anti-separatism and counter-terrorism.</h4>

		<div id = "australia"><h1 class = 'continent'><u>Australia</u></h1>
				<h2 class = 'subOne'>Attacks Against Australian Muslims Increase</h2>
				<img src = "australia.PNG"/>
				<h4>Muslims in Australia say they are increasingly being viewed with suspicion after the Paris attacks. Some say they are being abused by strangers on the streets. Others say a security crackdown by police and government authorities unfairly targets their community. Australia announced in September that it would accept 12,000 refugees from Syria and Iraq. The sudden surge of Muslims have caused tension between the Muslim community and many Australians. </h4>
