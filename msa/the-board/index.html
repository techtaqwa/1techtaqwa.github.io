              <p>It's hard being an optimist. There were so many times in my life where my positive attitude and big ideas were treated as naïve aspirations that had no chance of happening. Being a board member this year finally gave me a platform to forge possible impossibilities through prayer areas, MSA events and MIST promos that had never been done before. I can never thank Allah enough for giving me a place where I can serve my deen and Ummah—with pure, unadulterated, genuine happiness—all without limits.</p>

              <p>Assalamu Alaikum wa rahmra thullahi wabarakatu! My name's Masuma and I'm half of the Tech MSA presidency. I' ve been in the Gateway to Medicine major since freshman year and insha Allah i hope to be a pediatric surgeon some day. Even though being on the board with these other five amazing people can be a true struggle sometimes, the outcome is always amazing. As long as we always have our intentions right, Allah will provide us with the best, for He is the best of planners. This is what helps me get through the day, and food of course!</p>

              <p>My name is Helal, I've been in mist twice so far, and I can say for sure that I'll be in it next year and if I got the chance I would choose to be in it for the rest of my life. Even before I started high school I started hearing amazing things about mist and everyone I met really advised that I join it. So when the time came, I chose to give it a shot. And after only one year of being in it, I can confidently say that MIST has been the biggest and best experience in my life. The environment was very welcoming and the people were very kind. For me, my team is my family, but my family doesn't just stop there. MIST has pushed me to my limits and has allowed me to put dedication into my work, and I can say with certainty that it was by far one the best things that Allah could have blessed me with.</p>

              <p>Salaam!! My name is Tamanna Hussain and I have been in MIST for the past two years. I joined it freshmen year because a senior recommended it to me and honestly, listening to him was one of the best choices I have made. I've created an unbreakable bond with people that hold a very special place in my heart and I am incredibly grateful to have met them. MIST has helped me remove the veil that I have always found comfort hiding behind and it has helped me strive to be the best I can while having as much fun as possible. With only a year left in high school, I plan on making the best of the time I have left.</p>

<p>Salam, I am Tousif Khan, and I hail from the city of Sylhet, BD. I moved to America early in my life, living most of my childhood in Tampa, FL. But joining MIST freshmen year rooted my place here in NY. It was at MIST where I found a place I truly belong in. Being around an Islamic atmosphere with fellow brothers and sisters shaped me to be a better person and a better Muslim. It's because of MIST I am who I am now.</p>

              <p>Salam, I'm Yasin Ehsan. I come from Boston, MA. At age 5 I moved to NY. Knowing not one friend nor family, I felt as if I didn't belong here. However as the years passed, I found more and more people who I could call friends. Alhamdulilah until HS I've always remained in an Islamic atmosphere. So walking into brooklyn tech was actually my first steps into the public school enviroment, and boy it wasn't pleasant. However I liked Msa. It was a place where I could find friends and role models. Most importantly it was a place where I could learn more about Islam: which after all was my culture, my religion and my way of life. The first year I joined mist as tech taqwa, I had a great time competing and I belonged to the best team anyone could ask for, TECH TAQWA.</p>
