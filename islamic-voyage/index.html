        <p class="lead blog-description" align="left">Islam comes from the Arabic root word which stands for both submission and peace. The word Islam means "submission to the will of Allah." It establishes the principle that by surrending one's will to the will of Allah, one can let go of all the fears and earthly temptations so that they can finally find peace in their soul. It is not wealth nor riches that will bring us a sense of harmony and balance. Only submitting to our Creator can bring those things. The Prophet Muhammad peace and blessing be upon him once said, "True wealth does not come from an abundance of things. True welath comes from a contented heart." </p>

        <tab class="lead blog-description" align="left"></tab>

        <p class="lead blog-description" align="left">
The 5 pillars of Islam are it's core components. These are everything one needs to do as a Muslim. 
Shahadah, Salah, Zakat, Hajj, Sawm </p>
        <img src="2014 - 1.jpg"/>
        <h2 class="blog-title" align="left">The Seven Main Beliefs</h2>
        <p class="lead blog-description" align="left"><strong>Belief in His books:</strong> Muslims believe that Allah has revealed Holy Books or scriptures to prophets and messengers as a means of guiding humankind back to the right path. Some of the Holy Scriptures include:<br/>The Zabur (The Psalms): revealed to Prophet Dawud (David)<br/>The Torat (The Old Testament): revealed to Prophet Musa (Moses)</br>The Injeel (The New Testament): revealed to Prophet Isa (Jesus)</br>The Qur'an (The Final Testament): revealed to Prophet Muhammad</p>
        <p class="lead blog-description" align="left"><strong>Belief in the Angels of Allah:</strong> Muslims believe in Angels, unseen beings who worship Allah and carry out orders for Him<br/><ul align="left"><li class="lead blog-description">Angel Jibreel (Gabriel): the Angel of Revelation, carries the message of Allah from the Heavens to the Prophet</li><li class="lead blog-description">Angel Mikail (Michael): the Angel of Mercy, provides nourishments for bodies and souls, responsible for bringing rain and thunder to Earth</li><li class="lead blog-description">Angel Israfil (Raphael): the Angel who will blow the trumpet at Yawm al-Qiyamah (Day of
   Judgement). </li><li class="lead blog-description">Angel Azrael: the Angel of Death, the Keeper of Hell. Responsible for parting the soul
   from the body</li></ul></p>
        <p class="lead blog-description" align="left"><strong>Belief in Yawm al-Qiyamah (the Day of Judgement):</strong> Muslims beleive that humans will face a day  when they will be judged by the deeds they commited in this life. Those who followed Allah's commandments and performed lots of good deeds will be rewarded, and those who ignored Allah's commandments, turned away from it, and performeda multitude of evil acts without seeking repentance will be punished.</p>
        <p class="lead blog-description" align="left"><strong>Belief in Qadr (Divine Pre-destination):</strong> Belief in the omnipotence and omniscience of Allah. This mandates us to believe and accept any good and any evil that befalls us as coming from the perfect plan of Allah; and Allah is the best of planners.</p>
