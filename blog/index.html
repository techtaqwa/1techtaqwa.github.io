            <img src = "riya.jpg"/>
            <p>Our Loving Prophet (p.b.u.h) warned us beforehand, "The thing that I fear most for you is the minor Shirk; Riya'."<br/>How to Avoid Riya': <br/>1. Befriend the Qu'ran: Qu'ran for any Muslim is the guide to the right path. People are forgetful creatures, and the Holy Book is here for reminder and rememberance.<br/>2. Know Your Rabb: People often praise others who are at a higher position in life. However, they forget that the only one worthy of such praise is Allah, and only Allah.<br/>3. Don't Fear the People: People sometimes are conscious of their actions because they fear the criticisms, but the only one who has any right to judge the people and any living thing is Allah.<br/>4. Hide Good Deeds: People should hide their good deeds and perform some secret deeds only for the sake of Allah.<br/>5. Dua': Dua' is the greaatest helper along the path of paradise.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Secrets of Ikhlas</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">March 1, 2016 by <a href="#">Muhammad Shahid</a></p>
            <p>Ikhlas is something that Allah puts in the heart of worshipers who seek it. Sheikh Omar AbdelKafy said that there are 3 secrets of Ikhlas:</p>
            <p>The servant who has ikhlas does not look at it, because that would make him arrogant. For example, if we pray in a small room where no one can see us and yet due to that we feel that we are better than others because ‘obviously’ have ikhlas, we fall into the trap of arrogance. At the end of the day, success is only from Allah.
            Ikhlas is between the servant and His Lord; even the Angels don’t write it down because they don’t know it. Reflective of this is the story of the martyr, scholar and charitable man that we mentioned above – the Angels had written down the good they did, but it was Allah who exposed their intention.
            Satan cannot get to you if you have ikhlas 2</p>
            <p>Examples of those with Ikhlas: </p>
            <p>There is a beautiful example in the mother of Mariam (as). “When the wife of ‘Imran said, “My Lord, indeed I have pledged to You what is in my womb, consecrated [for Your service], so accept this from me. Indeed, You are the Hearing, the Knowing” (Qur’an, 3:35). She was having a beautiful private conversation with Allah. She told Him the child that was in her womb was solely for Him. She would raise it in the way of Allah, so that the child would be a worshipper of Allah, not for any reason save His pleasure. And for that sincere conversation, Allah rewarded her with one of the best women: Mariam (as), who fulfilled her mother’s pledge, by the grace of Allah.</p>
            <p>Another example is Khalid bin al-Walid (ra). He was removed from his post as commander of the army by ‘Umar. Imagine being the head of a youth group, captain of a sports team, or a manager at a company. Suddenly there is a change of management – you are removed from your position and demoted to a regular team member or employee. How would you react? How would that affect your work? Instead of being offended and refusing to fight, Khalid fought with even more vigor. When he was asked why, he said: “I fight for Allah and not for Umar.” He wanted to ensure that he was not working hard because he was put in a specific position – rather wherever he was, he would work hard for the sake of Allah.</p>
            <p>May Allah help us attain ikhlas.</p>

            <img src = "show.png"/>
            <p>Everything you do doesn't need praise.<br/>If you are aware of your intention<br/>the glory is already yours.<br/>The constant need for acknowledgement and approval<br/>will divert your purpose.</p>
